# Observability Triage

Analyze monitoring data and triage issues into beads.

## Workflows

This skill has two workflows. **Choose based on whether `docs/MONITORING.md`
exists:**

### 1. Setup Monitoring Configuration

**Use when:** `docs/MONITORING.md` does not exist, OR user wants to update
the monitoring configuration.

**Also use when:** User asks to analyze monitoring data but no
`docs/MONITORING.md` exists — create it first, then proceed to workflow 2.

**[setup-monitoring-config.md](references/setup-monitoring-config.md)** —
Interactive guide for creating `docs/MONITORING.md` through conversation
with the user.

### 2. Analyze and Triage

**Use when:** `docs/MONITORING.md` exists and user wants to analyze
monitoring data.

**[analyze-and-triage.md](references/analyze-and-triage.md)** — Fetch
monitoring data, identify issues, check for duplicates, create or update
beads.
